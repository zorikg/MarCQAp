{"data": [{"paragraphs": [{"context": "Once upon a time, in a barn near a farm house, there lived a little white kitten named Cotton.

She shared her hay bed with her mommy and 5 other sisters. All of her sisters were cute and fluffy, like Cotton. But she was the only white one in the bunch. The rest of her sisters were all orange with beautiful white tiger stripes like Cotton's mommy. Being different made Cotton quite sad. She often wished she looked like the rest of her family. So one day, when Cotton found a can of the old farmer's orange paint, she used it to paint herself like them. When her mommy and sisters found her they started laughing. \n\n\"What are you doing, Cotton?!\" \n\n\"I only wanted to be more like you\". \n\nCotton's mommy rubbed her face on Cotton's and said \"Oh Cotton, but your fur is so pretty and special, like you. We would never want you to be any other way\". And with that, Cotton's mommy picked her up and dropped her into a big bucket of water. When Cotton came out she was herself again. Her sisters licked her face until Cotton's fur was all all dry. \n\n\"Don't ever do that again, Cotton!\" they all cried. \"Next time you might mess up that pretty white fur of yours and we wouldn't want that!\" \n\nThen Cotton thought, \"I change my mind.

He had lived there all his life. Jerry's mother was named Marge, and she was 36. Marge raised Jerry at the railroad tracks because she wanted to keep him safe. She was afraid of the people who lived in the town nearby. The town was named Qarth, and 100 people lived there. Marge believed that the people of Qarth would attack them if they knew they were there. Qarth used to be filled with factories when Jerry was born. By the time Jerry was a teenager, most of the factories had gone away and most of the people worked on special new machines. They ate food from the fields outside of town. Their favorite food to eat was a special kind of corn. They didn't eat meat because nobody raised any farm animals. One day when he was 11, Jerry asked his mother who his father had been. His father's name was George, and he was 2 years older than Marge. Marge looked sad and told Jerry that George had left after he was born because the people in the town didn't like him. This made Jerry very sad. He went off to his corner of the car and didn't talk to Marge again until she went to bed. After she fell asleep he wanted to go out and look for his father. He packed some food and left. When Marge woke up she was upset, but she thought she knew where he had gone.

After hearing this, his mom marched him up to the bathroom and forced him to brush his teeth. \"You won't get teased if you brush your teeth, Joey!\" she yelled, and then left the room. From that day forward, Joey brushed his teeth every day so the other kids wouldn't make fun of him.

First, was Muffins the Cat. The second show was Ernie the Talking Donkey. The third was Laughing with Herman Hamster. His Mom told him to go to bed, but Douglas didn't listen. He fell asleep on the couch. He dreamed all night. First about sheep jumping fences. Second about playing fetch the ball with Ruffles. Third about Ernie the talking Donkey kicking a soccer ball over the moon. Fourth about his favorite soccer player, Pele, head the ball in the goal. \n\nFinally, the next morning, Douglas got up late because he was so tired. His Mom called him and the alarm went off, but he did not hear. To get Douglas up, his Mom got Ruffles the dog to lick him in the face. Douglas got up but had to eat breakfast fast.

The coach was surprised that Douglas was so slow. Usually he was fast. After the second quarter, the Dolphins were losing two to one after Howard scored again for the Lions and Toby scored a goal for the Dolphins. While the coach gave energy drinks to the team, Douglas fell asleep. The third quarter started. \n\nDouglas was snoring when the coach told him to go in. When he saw Douglas was sleeping, he sent Billy into the game. Billy scored one goal and the Dolphins had tied the game two to two. Ruffles the dog started barking and then licking Douglas in the face. Douglas got up and stretched. He was finally well rested. The coach saw Douglas and sent him into the game. Douglas remembered his dream. In the last second, he headed the ball in the goal like Pele. He won the game. The team cheered. \n\nSince that time, Douglas goes to bed on time.

For many years, his life carried on this way. He would wake up on the farm, go to work, and then come home to dream about flying. That is, until one day, he got a letter with a strange sticker on it, that was shaped like a star. He opened the letter in excitement, wondering what it said. The letter said that Oink was invited to a special party that took place every year in the clouds. Animals from all across the world were chosen so that they could know what it's like to fly. If he chose to go to the party, he would get his own set of wings to fly up into the sky and meet the other animals. Oink was so happy, he barely knew how to react. He accepted the invitation, and two days later, got a package containing his wings. Oink's dream was finally coming true. He put the wings on his back and flew up into the sky, where the party was being held. Once he arrived, he saw a bunch of other animals with wings also. He saw horses, dogs, cats, and plenty of birds. Oink had found out that it was the birds who had invited everyone, since they wanted the other animals to know what it is like to fly. Oink spent that day flying in the clouds with his new friends. But when the clock reached midnight, he knew his time flying was up, and he had to return the wings and go back to his farm. But the birds told him that they saw how much he enjoyed flying, and would allow him to keep his wings so he could fly with them whenever he wanted. Oink was really thankful, and next time he saw the birds, gave them their own pair of shoes for free as a thank you gift.

It was black with brown and white spots. He picked the puppy up and hugged it. Then he saw his friend Alice. He gave the bell to Alice, who rang the bell and wished for a pretty bird. Soon a pretty bird landed on her shoulder. Alice thought the bell was a wonderful thing, and chose to keep it, rather than give it away. The next day when she woke up, her bird had flown away.

His friend was a cat named Shelly who loved to play baseball. The two of them would go to the park and play baseball with Lucy a lamb who lived next door. \n\nIt was Friday morning and Bob and Shelly were in the park waiting for Lucy. She was late and when she finally showed up she had forgotten the ball. \n\n\"What can we use for a ball?\" Bob asked. They looked around. There were rocks but they were too hard. There could get mud out of the pond but that would be too soft and splat when they hit it with the wooden bat. Finally Bob, being the tallest, saw that in a pile of plants that there were melons growing. \"Let's use a melon,\" Bob said. \"That's stupid,\" said Shelly, the practical one. \"No hear him out,\" said Lucy. \"It might work. \"It'll work,\" said Bob, and he picked a melon and handed it to Shelly. \"You pitch.\" \"This is going to end badly, I'm afraid,\" Shelly said, throwing the melon at Bob who stood over home plate. \"I know what I'm doing,\" Bob said, swinging the bat as hard as he could. When the bat hit the melon it splatted into a million pieces, raining sticky pieces down on Bob and Shelly and Lucy and a wedding party that had been setting up nearby. \"Oops,\" said Bob.

She had two dogs, a brother, a sister, and a mom and dad. Every day she woke up and went to kindergarten, played outside, and watched movies. Sometimes her family would go to a rollercoaster park. Her mom would always try to get her to ride the big rides but she was afraid and wanted to stay in Snoopyland. For two years she stayed in the little kid section of the park. Her big brother who had to babysit her was getting mad because she would not try new rides. She cried more and more until one day she got brave. She went on a little bigger musical ride that went around in circles pretty fast. She got off the ride and loved it! Her mom said to her, \"Okay, let's go on the big kid rides now!\" Megan was afraid again and cried and cried. For the rest of that summer she stayed in the little kid section and went on little rides. The next summer her brother brought his girlfriend home. His girlfriend's name was Sara and she was older, and loved big rides. Megan liked Sara a lot and wanted to make her like her. When Sara asked Megan if she would ride on bigger rides she said yes, and she went on her first real rollercoaster, Thunderhawk. She was frightened at first but when she stepped off the ride she loved it like she had loved the other ride last year! Now was the real test. Sara asked Megan if she wanted to go on the biggest ride in the park. She was afraid but wanted to show Sara how big she was. At the beginning of the ride Megan was afraid and was about to start crying when they went down the first big hill. Her stomach was tickled and she began laughing really loud. She stepped off the ride with a huge smile on her face and was very proud. Megan was no longer afraid of the big rides and enjoyed riding them for the rest of her life.

It was a hot July day, and I was bored. My grandfather was sitting in the backyard, reading. \"Hey, you look like you need some fun,\" he said. \"Want to go fishing?\" I said sure, and he went to the garage. He came out with two poles, some hooks, and some fishing line. Everything was in pieces, but he showed me how to put it all together. I asked if we needed worms, and he said no. Then, we set off to the river. \n\nIt was only about ten blocks to the river, but walking along past the library and the store, he told me about how he used to go fishing with his friend Steve. They used to catch catfish, then take them home so that their mothers could cook them for dinner. When we got to the park at the river, my grandfather went right to the bank, then turned and walked up along the side of the river until we were off in the shade under the trees right at the edge of the park.

He could not wait to get to the zoo and most of all could not wait to see his favorite animal, the lion. Aiming the football at the tire swing that hung in his back yard, he remembered the second thing his dad had taught him about throwing a football which was making sure his shoulder and the football were in a straight line before he threw it. He watched the football sail toward the tire, right as his mom called him in for dinner. His mom had made his favorite food, hotdogs. He sat in the kitchen and watched as ketchup fell on to his plate as he ate his hotdog. His mom told him that in order to get his after dinner treat he would have to eat his corn, carrots, and drink all of his milk too. \n\nThat night as his mom tucked him in to bed he starred out the window and wondered if the lions at the zoo were looking up at the moon too. Michael, wondered if his best friends Joe, Nick, and Ryan were as excited as he was about going to the zoo the next day. He closed his eyes and went to sleep. \n\nThe next day he hopped from one foot to the other as his class lined up to get on the bus that would take him to the zoo. On the bus he sat with Ryan. The bus driver started the engine and turned the big steering wheel leading them out on to the road. Finally, at the zoo Michael began to imagine how cool it would be to finally get to see the lion cage. First his class went to see the monkeys and then headed over to see the long necked giraffes. As their teacher announced that they would then be going to see the elephants, we wondered if he would ever get to see the lions. Finally after learning about the elephants it was time to see the lions. The lion stood on a huge rock and swung its long tail from side to side. The lion licked his lips with its long pink tongue and Michael wondered if it was thinking about having a class full of kids for its lunch.

My mom and dad were in the front seat, and my sister and I were in the back seat. My sister and I were very bored, but we had to sit still and stay quiet for a lot of the time because our dad needed to be a good driver. My sister and I played with our dolls, or we tried to play easy games. I could not read or eat in the car because I felt too sick. My sister spilled Coke on the car and my mom spanked her with a glove. The look of sadness on my sister's face almost made me cry, too! We got to the ocean so late at night, but we took a nice walk next to the ocean and then we went to bed. We were so tired from doing nothing all day!
