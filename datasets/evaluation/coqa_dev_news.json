{"data": [{"paragraphs": [{"context": "(CNN) -- Dennis Farina, the dapper, mustachioed cop-turned-actor best known for his tough-as-nails work in such TV series as \"Law & Order,\" \"Crime Story,\" and \"Miami Vice,\" has died. He was 69. \n\n\"We are deeply saddened by the loss of a great actor and a wonderful man,\" said his publicist, Lori De Waal, in a statement Monday. \"Dennis Farina was always warmhearted and professional, with a great sense of humor and passion for his profession. He will be greatly missed by his family, friends and colleagues.\" \n\nFarina, who had a long career as a police officer in Chicago, got into acting through director Michael Mann, who used him as a consultant and cast him in his 1981 movie, \"Thief.\" That role led to others in such Mann-created shows as \"Miami Vice\" (in which Farina played a mobster) and \"Crime Story\" (in which he starred as Lt. Mike Torello). \n\nFarina also had roles, generally as either cops or gangsters, in a number of movies, including \"Midnight Run\" (1988), \"Get Shorty\" (1995), \"The Mod Squad\" (1999) and \"Snatch\" (2000). \n\nIn 2004, he joined the cast of the long-running \"Law & Order\" after Jerry Orbach's departure, playing Detective Joe Fontana, a role he reprised on the spinoff \"Trial by Jury.\" Fontana was known for flashy clothes and an expensive car, a distinct counterpoint to Orbach's rumpled Lennie Briscoe. \n\nFarina was on \"Law & Order\" for two years, partnered with Jesse L. Martin's Ed Green. Martin's character became a senior detective after Farina left the show.

Barring a political miracle, Republican Ken Cuccinelli will be delivering a concession speech on Tuesday evening in Richmond. \n\nIn recent cycles, the Virginia race has been a key off-year barometer of national political sentiment. Four years ago, Republican Bob McDonnell won in blowout fashion, a victory that presaged the following year's GOP midterm wave. In 2005, Democrat Tim Kaine captured the governor's mansion, tapping into anxiety about President George W. Bush's handling of the Iraq War and Hurricane Katrina. \n\nNot so this year. The McAuliffe-Cuccinelli race has been defined by small-bore issues and character attacks rather than sweeping national concerns. \n\nBut despite the lack of late fireworks, there are plenty of crucial insights to be gleaned from the Virginia campaign. \n\nHere's what you need to know about this year's most important race: \n\n1. The 2012 playbook is still potent for Democrats \n\nMcAuliffe isn't exactly squeaky-clean. A longtime wheeler-dealer who has been less than forthcoming with his tax returns, \"the Macker\" has a history of eyebrow-raising business ventures that make for dangerous campaign fodder. The opposition research book on the former Democratic National Committee chairman is as thick a Virginia live oak. \n\nBut Democrats have successfully turned the race into a referendum on Cuccinelli, defining him over the summer as a right-wing zealot. A Washington Post poll last week showed that two-thirds of McAuliffe supporters said they were voting against Cuccinelli, rather than for McAuliffe.

University of Texas. Abigail Fisher, a white woman, argues that she has been a victim of the university's race-conscious admission policies; the university contends that its drive for racial and ethnic diversity is educationally enriching -- a benefit to all students. \n\nWill the ugly discourse that generally characterizes debate over racially preferential policies disappear with the wave of a magic Supreme Court wand? It seems unlikely. The issue is a cat with many more than nine lives. It arrived in the early 1970s and, despite many attacks, some of which have taken the form of amendments to state constitutions, it has survived in pretty fine fettle. \n\nThe court will have only eight justices to hear the arguments. Elena Kagan, having been involved in the case as solicitor general in the Obama administration, has bowed out of participation. Her absence, however, leaves five justices likely to express at least some degree of skepticism about the racial preferences given to non-Asian minorities in the admissions process. \n\nHas the University of Texas been enriched by academic diversity? Maybe. But equally likely is the possibility that racial double standards reinforce stereotypes about smart whites and even smarter Asians. There are certainly wide gaps in the average SAT scores between blacks and Hispanics, on the one hand, and whites and Asians, on the other hand. \n\nAmong freshmen entering the University of Texas in 2009 who did not fall into the top 10% of their high school class (automatic admission at the university), Asians scored at the 93rd percentile of 2009 SAT takers nationwide, whites at the 89th percentile, Hispanics at the 80th percentile and blacks at the 52nd percentile. Startling? No. This picture has been well known for a long time. Heartbreaking, yes, because the numbers mean the underperforming minority students are being woefully ill served by the K-12 school system.

But it was \"Do the Right Thing,\" made when Lee was just 32, that showcased his confidence, from the deliberately striking color scheme (bright reds and oranges that make a hot day seem even hotter) to its heightened -- sometimes stagy -- atmosphere, to its grim, documentary-style riot climax.

Movie rights are already spoken for by Chernin Entertainment, the studio behind \"Oblivion\" and \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,\" and critics are raving about Pessl's multimedia storytelling approach, which takes readers beyond the novel's pages to explore the story of a mysterious director and the washed-up reporter out to expose him. \n\nPessl's fictional mash-up of Stanley Kubrick, Roman Polanski and David Lynch hasn't been seen in public for 30 years. His movies are so frightening no theater will show them; his cult of fans meet in abandoned buildings and underground tunnels for secret screenings. \n\nInvestigative journalist Scott McGrath tried to expose Cordova years ago and it backfired, costing him his job, marriage and reputation. When Cordova's daughter turns up dead in an apparent suicide, McGrath sees an opportunity to exact revenge against the man he blames for his downfall. \n\nPessl weaves into the narrative excerpts from magazine articles, newspaper headlines, police reports, crime scene photos and screen shots of online message boards. She also wrote and directed several short films being featured over the next few weeks on YouTube that offer clues into the book's mystery, including snippets and trailers from Cordova's films.

Meanwhile, my life is going down the drain.\" \n\nHe lost his house, his Mercedes, and then his wife left him. In his 40s, he was forced to take the humiliating step of moving in with his mother.

Private detectives in modern-day Los Angeles, they're the stars of best-selling author Robert Crais' award-winning series of crime novels. Elvis and Joe have been busting bad guys and thrilling millions of readers since 1987's \"The Monkey's Raincoat.\" The books are international bestsellers, published in 42 countries, and have developed a fervent following. \n\nIn \"Taken,\" Crais's newest novel, his 15th featuring the daring duo, Elvis and Joe take on an especially bloodthirsty group of criminals called bajadores. They are bandits who prey on other bandits along the U.S.-Mexico border, dealing in drugs, murder and kidnapping. \n\n\"Taken\" is intense and fast-paced and reads like a big-budget Hollywood blockbuster. Though that's not surprising when you consider Crais began his career writing for television series like \"Hill Street Blues,\" \"Cagney & Lacey\" and \"Miami Vice.\" \n\nCNN recently spoke to the author about his new book, his loyal fans and why he's refused to bring Elvis and Joe to the big screen. The following is an edited transcript. \n\nCNN: How has writing about Elvis Cole and Joe Pike changed over the course of the series? \n\nCrais: I really strive to bring something new to each book. I don't want to write the same book over and over again. I've done Elvis books; I've done Joe books; I've done mixed books, but this time, I made a conscious decision I wanted to tell a story where I could split the book pretty much down the middle and give them 50-50 equal footing so they both have their starring roles. When I discovered this particular story, it just seemed a perfect way to do that. Part of the book, they're working together. Then there's Elvis' track through the story, and there's Joe track, where he's trying to find Elvis and save him. So it just seemed like an ideal way to let these guys share the stage.

Their cases share a common thread -- repeated concussions, sub-concussive blows to the head, or both. The picture beginning to emerge from these cases is that trauma could be causing brain damage. \n\nA brain with CTE is riddled with dense clumps of a protein called tau. Under a microscope, tau appears as brown tangles that look similar to dementia. Except the cases of CTE have shown this progressive, dementia-like array in players well in advance of a typical dementia diagnosis, which typically occurs in the 70s or 80s. \n\nMike Webster, an offensive lineman with the Pittsburgh Steelers whose CTE was also diagnosed posthumously, was 50 when he died. John Grimsley, a nine-year NFL veteran who played most of his career with the Houston Oilers, was 45, and Duerson was 50. Scientists at Boston University have found evidence of CTE in the brain of an athlete as young as 18.

Michael Schumacher? Maybe Alain Prost? Ayrton Senna perhaps? In an exclusive interview with CNN, three-time Formula One world champion, Jackie Stewart had no hesitation in naming his choice for the greatest driver of all-time. \n\nThree-time F1 champion, Jackie Stewart back in his heyday. \n\n\"My hero, and the man I most respected and probably still do is Juan Manuel Fangio.\" Stewart told CNN. \n\nIt's not misty-eyed nostalgia for a bygone era that persuades \"The Flying Scot,\" as Stewart became known. And it wasn't just Fangio's tally of world titles that convinced Stewart; it is the manner in which the Argentine legend saw off his rivals. Who do you think is the greatest? \n\n\"Fangio won five world championships almost in a different car every year. He had the dignity, the style and the ability,\" Stewart explained. \n\nWhat's more, as Stewart points out, Fangio didn't start racing in Formula One until he was 39-years-old, and whether driving a Ferrari, Lancia, Maserati or Mercedes, he kept on winning races. \n\nThough Fangio was the greatest, Stewart rated fellow countryman Jim Clark as the best driver he raced against. \n\n\"His batting average was very good and he didn't race in too many grands prix.\" Clark -- who was tragically killed racing at Hockenheim in 1968 -- won 25 of his 73 Formula One races. Stewart's record is comparable, winning 27 from 100 starts. \n\nIt's this win to race ratio that really separates the good from the great Stewart believes.
