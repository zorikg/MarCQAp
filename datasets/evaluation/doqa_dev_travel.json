When he does apply make sure he builds a good argument for why he should return home. And consider a shorter trip - weeks rather than months.

You are far more likely to cause damage to your phone by dropping it when trying to put it in the tray than you are having it broken by the equipment itself. There is no need to remove your Kindle from your carry-on bag, so just make sure it's packed well and you'll be fine. If you're carrying a laptop you WILL need to remove that from your bag (unless you have a special TSA-approved laptop bag) - again the only real risk is in dropping it or forgetting to collect it afterwards.

However, it does provide an impeccable ground for the border officer to deny you entry if he doesn't like the color of your shoes. And it is possible that the airline will refuse boarding you if you have neither a valid visa nor a round-trip ticket.

If the device contains an AC motor directly driven by the mains voltage, reducing the mains frequency will indeed cause the motor to rotate slower, but it may also overload the motor. It is difficult to easily explain the physics behind this, but basically, a motor needs a larger magnetic core to run on a lower AC frequency. If the magnetic core is not large enough, it might saturate during the AC cycle (with is longer if the frequency is lower), cause a significant current increase and finally the motor to overheat. Electrical motors are also often cooled by a fan attached to the motor shaft, so reducing the rotation speed of the motor may lead to insufficient cooling of the motor block itself.

My family owns a cabin on a very small private island. When I was little, we would arrange with the ferry to drop us off. He would then sail right up close to our pier, and we would jump ashore before he reversed out. When we wanted to go home, we would contact the ferryman by radio, and he would pick us up on his next scheduled trip. Today, the island close to ours is road-connected, so now we simply have a small boat there to travel the last leg. I saw something similar on Svalbard. We were on a guided tour, when the boat stopped in the fjord to pick up people by a RIB they lowered from the ship (likely locals who had been visiting their cabin). However, as far as I'm aware, this is only necesarry when your final destination is not land-connected, and you make personal arrangements.

Delineating where an izakaya ends and a restaurant starts is an even tougher exercise. I like @TheWanderingCoder's definition of izakayas being primarily for drinking, while restaurants are primarily for eating, but even that can be a pretty fuzzy line in both directions: there are plenty of \"gourmet izakayas\" that would be restaurants if they called themselves that, and (for example) yakiniku grilled-meat restaurants that also offer all-you-can-drink deals and are primarily intended for people who want to get hammered.

In general, in physics, pressure on shorter structures has less chances of bending/breaking them. For exmaple, you can bend a metal stick of 1m length easier than a nail of the same diameter. So if you have pressure coming from above, the shortest edges should be vertical to maximise the resistance against the pressure. If you have a smaller luggage, the difference in centimeter between the various sides is smaller and therefore it does not matter so much which side it is on. Chances are high that the luggage will lie on top of others, or that luggages on top will be larger and therefore the pressure will not be on a small spot in a large surface but rather covering the whole surface of your luggage and thus the pressure is on the outer frame which is more stable than the center of the surface. However if you have a very large (and thin) luggage, you might not want to lie it on the larger surface since chances are high that a luggage lying on top is smaller and therefore not putting pressure on the more stable outer edges of the frame but on the softer center of the cover.

(Trucks may be able to see and suffer glare from your headlights even in situations where cars cannot; if you can see the windshields of trucks, or if trucks are flashing their headlights at you, stop using your high beams.) I drive on empty country roads, divided and not, and have done so for 40 years. These are my rules and I have never had a driver \"flash\" at me to lower my lights unless I have absent-mindedly forgotten to lower them (that is, never when I thought it would be ok to have them on) and neither have I had a \"wow, almost didn't see that\" moment from not having high beams on.

Take-off/landing is a little different. For take-off there's not a lot of difference - the nose of the plane leaves the ground first so there's normally a sharper movement at the front as that occurs, but the front is also off the ground earlier so potentially less bumpy for a short period of time.

I am not sure however about the less touristy spots, because by the time I got to such spots, I already had the opportunity to change my USD into JMD. Which is what you want to do anyway because vendors accepting USD will usually give you a bad rate.

Let me first clear up the confusion you have acquired by reading that page on Travelfish.org. They mention that the ferry to Indonesia takes \"a couple of days\" and \"is no cheaper than flying.\" They are not referring to the ferry to Batam, but rather to the overall journey from Singapore to Java, which as outlined in the article takes three legs, Batam being the first, easiest, and least significant. With that out of the way: these ferries are extremely safe. The terminal and vessels bear some resemblance to a small airport, and none to the sometimes-chaotic \"bumboat\" ferries that make short trips elsewhere in the region. The ships are proper ships, with proper seating, very seaworthy in appearance, and completely sealed against the weather (which is often calm anyway). The ferry trip is not very long and the crew are professional.

A machine readable passport is technically a requirement for entering the US, as well as for obtaining a US visa.

The \"machine readable\" strip on the passport is actually very simple - and thus the fact that yours apparently can't be read is at least suspicious. At a minimum it implies that your passport has been damaged somehow. At both your visa interview and (if you make it there) at the US border I would expect them to be very suspicious of a passport that will not scan. At a minimum, I would expect you to be sent to secondary screening whilst they attempt to confirm that your passport is valid and has not been modified in some way.

Usually this could be accomplished by proof of residency and firm connections in Vancouver, or by onward travel out of Canada already booked within a month, or by some other tangible document.
