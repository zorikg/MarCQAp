It will change the flavor a bit, but not necessarily badly.Fourth option is to add stuff. Sugar, creamer powder, spices (possibly brought from home), whatever pleases you - and some of which might already be present for doctoring coffee. Any of these options should add some flavor, changing the taste but perhaps not badly. I wouldn't recommend milk, since (as you mention) it has enough liquid it can dilute the flavors, but powdered flavorings might help (and not dilute).

It happens even shortly after frying if the food item is placed on a flat surface where the inner steam can't escape and is trapped between the food and the surface under it. This is why when frying large batches or holding fried food for any extended time, it's best to drain on a cooling rack that's upside down on a brown paper bag or paper towels.

With a mild-flavored organ meat like foie gras, we could taste a difference, but, frankly, in our tests, we prefer the taste of water-soaked to milk-soaked foie gras.

it is much safer to transport food cold (frozen, even) than hot. You can buy soft-sided insulated bags with straps - I see them in the grocery store - that should be ok for a trip of that length. I buy frozen food and then drive home for an hour with it, put it straight in the freezer, and would laugh at the thought of there being food-safety issues with that. So one approach is to make a lasagna, casserole, or the like in a disposable container, freeze it at home, take it to your relative's and put it in her freezer. Now she has a semi-quick (but at least easy) meal waiting for her.(A side note from remembering my days with an infant: something that heats up FAST and can be eaten with one hand will be more useful than a serves-12-needs-a-fork-heats-for-an-hour option.

With starches, the cells explode when heated, but xanthan gum simply needs to be hydrated, and it can be hydrated at any temperature. Mix a smaller amount of xanthan gum in water in your metal cup, add water, and blend it with your immersion blender. For your slurry, you're looking for a consistency which is much thicker than your sauce, but still thin enough to be able to stir in fairly easily.

Remember, dutch ovens are thick, heavy, and slow to transmit heat, and the recipes reflect this.I would avoid doubling either the pan or the foil: you'll end up with an air gap between the two layers, which will likely just end up ruining the outer pan. Pay a little extra for the thicker \"heavy-duty\" foil and you should be fine.Wet sand between two pans is an interesting idea... If you try it, report back!My biggest worry here would be burning the peaches before they have a chance to release their juices (no slow warm-up with aluminum - you'll essentially be frying them).

As for cooking time it really depends on the size (which means the potatoes are likely done at different times) but you can always feel when they are done by pressing on the potato with a fork - it should give slightly/be soft. I think it usually took me about 30min but I didn't use a clock. It may shorten the cooking time slightly to make holes in the potatoes with a fork (this also adds to the \"creaminess\"). I guess they do sometimes get a softer, more \"creamy\" consistency than your usual potato when well done. However the taste is richer and in my opinion far superior to orange sweet potato. If you prefer a firmer potato, just let your potatoes stay on the firm side (in my experience, though, the taste is enhanced by letting them go soft).

So limiting the discussion to natural, high quality finishing salts, the differences are mainly texture and color. Some salts, like Maldon, are flaky, while others are large pyramids or cubes, and others tend to a small grain size and hold on to a bit of moisture. Each of these textures can bring something special to a finished dish. For example, flaky Maldon adds a delightful crunch, while another salt might adhere better to a French fry. Color, like the pink salt you mention, is used pretty much for the visual interest. And there is nothing wrong with that. Simply save it for a dish where it will be noticeable. For example, those pink grains would look amazing on a chocolate truffle, or a savory meringue.If anyone thinks they can actually taste the difference among unflavored finishing salts, I'd challenge them to do a triangle test with those salts dissolved in water (in equal amounts by weight) so that texture and color isn't confusing the issue.

While the pressure cooker will make things cook faster, it won't necessarily make the flavors extract dramatically quicker, so you may find that the flavor hasn't really peaked in the shorter cooking time. Or if you expect wine, for instance, to permeate into the meat, it will do more of that over a longer cooking time, than the short, but more intense time that your food spends in a pressure cooker.An easy way to decide might be to think about if you have one of those recipes that is \"better the next day\". That recipe is likely to benefit from the low slow pan cooking.In the end, your best bet is to make it twice, in a reasonably short space of time, and then decide for yourself.

To roast the bones, just stick them in an oven on high heat, around 450 for about 45 minutes, or until they are a nice golden caramelized color. Though you will want to make sure to keep an eye on them the first time, I'd check every 5 minutes after half an hour. Roasting the veggies with the bones will also add a slightly sweeter roasted flavor. It's like the difference of putting slices of raw onions on a burger compared to caramelized onions. You get a slightly sweeter, richer roasted flavor. Though it does turn down some of the other flavor notes, it's up to you which you'd rather have. Without roasting, you'd have a clearer \"white\" stock. If you are using the butter as a base to roast the bones, I would set it aside and go with a higher smoke point oil like a peanut or corn oil. The low smoke point of the butter could leave a bitter, slightly burned flavor, especially with the longer roasting times. I would leave the seasoning for the stock. Most spices will burn at a lower temperature, and salting the bones before you make your stock, could make your stock overly salty.

The iron itself melts at 1500\u00b0C. The seasoning can be burnt off at much lower temperatures, a self-cleaning cycle in the oven is enough for it (500\u00b0C). I have taken an iron pan to above 400\u00b0C without damaging the seasoning. (I don't know exactly how high it was, my thermometer doesn't go above 400\u00b0C). This was on an induction stove set at maximum, I doubt that any other kind of stove can produce such temperatures. Edit I just heard an example showing that you can take a pan on a resistive stove to above 500\u00b0C with prolonged heating, so you should be measuring it if you plan to go that high. (and if you have a thermometer in this range, you can post your findings to further limit the range of 400\u00b0 to 500\u00b0C, because I'm curious). But if you say \"no contents\", be careful that it is actually just the pan.
